# Unexpected Null Behavior in JavaScript

This repository demonstrates an uncommon yet subtle bug related to null handling in JavaScript functions.

## The Bug

The `bug.js` file contains a simple function `foo` that adds two numbers. It attempts to handle null values gracefully by returning null if either input is null. However, this approach can lead to unexpected behavior when one input is null and the other is a number.

## The Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version of `foo` that addresses this issue.  The solution uses strict equality checks and handles the case where one argument is null and the other is a number appropriately, either by returning the non-null value or applying a different computation if needed.  More robust validation and error handling are added to improve code quality and reliability.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.js` and observe the function's behavior with null and non-null inputs.
3. Compare the results with the corrected function in `bugSolution.js`. 

This example highlights the importance of carefully considering null values and implementing robust error handling to prevent unexpected behavior in JavaScript applications.
